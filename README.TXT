A fully fledged laravel application built using laragon and composer.
This is a Todo application that not only offers users a way to track their pending activities, but also offers authentication where users can only see the todo activities that belong to them.
Registration and Login among other bootstrap auth pages.
Uses mysql as the database connection.

Considering you have laragon or anyother tool like XAMP, and composer and npm installed, you can just pull the repository and run 'npm install && npm run dev' on your terminal.
Check your configuration files, .env, php.ini.

This is the first version of this and more updates will come later.
